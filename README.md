# About me
Welcome to my Github! 

My name is Daniel Oyewole from the London, and I'm what is considered to be a self-taught programmer, I aim to change industies to become a junior front end developer. I started to learn to code out of pure curiosity, which has now snowballed into a full blown passion. What I loving about programming is that you have so much room to grow, no atter what stage you are at in your career. I'm currently focusing on imporving my skills in both ReactJS and Angular before going more in depth with Javascipt.
